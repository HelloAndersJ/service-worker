# Service worker test

A little test to try out how a service worker would work at a basic level

## Installation

Run `yarn install` for the required packages

Run `yarn dev` and open localhost:8080 in your browser

Open up your browser dev-tools and go to "Application" > "Service workers"

## Witness the wonder...

Toggle the "Offline" options and refresh browser to see the fallback view.
