# Service worker test

A little test to try out how a service worker would work at a basic level


## Installation

You will need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and optionally [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) if you haven't already.

The first thing you'll need to do is install any dependencies which you can do by running either:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

## Running Locally

Run one of the two following commands to get the project running locally:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080> in your default browser. It watches the files for any changes and live reloads the CSS and JavaScript.

## Production

To build this project for production run one of the following commands:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will compile/bundle all assets in the dist folder. **NOTE! This have not been intended for production. You are on your own...**

## Witness the wonder...

Toggle the "Offline" options and refresh browser to see the fallback view.
